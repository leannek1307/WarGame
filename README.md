The Game of War, fully written in **Java**, does the following:
- Shuffle deck of 52 cards (No jokers)
- Distribute cards to player1 and player2
- Each player places one card to the played pile (repeat)
  - Higher rank: take both cards
  - Tied: place three cards faced down, draw another, then compare
  - player1 and player2's pile is automatically shuffled every round
- No cards left: other player wins
- Player with all 52 cards wins
